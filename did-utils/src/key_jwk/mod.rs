//! This module provides types and utilities for handling JSON Web Keys (JWKs).
//! 
//! It includes support for various key types, secure serialization and deserialization, and encoding schemes.
//!
//! ## Submodules
//!
//! - [`bytes`]:  Contains utilities for handling byte sequences, including secure serialization and deserialization using Base64 encoding.
//! - [`ec`]:     Provides support for working with elliptic-curve keys.
//! - [`jwk`]:    Contains types and utilities for working with JSON Web Keys (JWKs).
//! - [`key`]:    Provides generic key types and associated utilities used in JSON Web Keys (JWKs).
//! - [`oct`]:    Provides supportfor working with octet sequence keys.
//! - [`okp`]:    Provides support for working with Octet Key Pairs (OKP).
//! - [`prm`]:    Defines parameter-related types for keys and cryptographic operations.
//! - [`rsa`]:    Provides support for working with RSA keys.
//! - [`secret`]: Provides utilities for working with secrets securely.
