# Handshake Flow for DIDComm Mediator-rs

## 1. Communication Initiation

### Participant Identification:
- Each edge agent generates a DID (Decentralized Identifier), typically involving some interaction with a mediator (cloud agent). The mediator is responsible for:
  1. Receiving messages sent to the edge agent.
  2. Forwarding messages sent out by the edge agent.
   

- Agents exchange their DIDs to identify each other. This exchange generally occurs in the context of an OOB(Out-of-Band) message, where one edge agent scans the QR code of another.
### Initial Message:
- The initiating edge agent sends a DIDComm handshake message to the mediator. This message contains:

  - **DID of the initiating edge agent**: Identifies the sender.
  - **Nonce**: Ensures message freshness and prevents replay attacks.
  - **Service Information**: May include endpoint URLs, service types, and other metadata relevant to the communication.
## 2. Message Exchanges

### Encryption Methods:
 - Messages are encrypted using DIDComm's encryption standards, typically using asymmetric encryption (e.g., using public keys derived from the DIDs).
 - 
### Data Formats:
 - Messages are structured in JSON format, following the DIDComm v2 specification. A typical message contains:
   - **Headers**: Metadata about the message (e.g., type, timestamp, sender, recipient).
   - **Payload**: The actual content of the message, encrypted as needed.
   - **Encryption Details**: Information about the encryption used, such as keys and algorithms.
  
### Sequence of Exchanges:

 - **Mediator Acknowledgment**: The mediator responds with its own DID and a nonce, acknowledging the receipt of the initial message.
   - **Capability Negotiation**: Both parties may exchange additional messages to negotiate capabilities, such as supported encryption algorithms, message formats, and routing mechanisms.
   - **Routing Information**: The mediator may provide routing information necessary for forwarding future messages between the agents.
  
## 3. Finalization

### Successful Connection:

 - The handshake is finalized when both parties have successfully exchanged all necessary cryptographic information and have verified each otherâ€™s identities.
 - A final confirmation message may be sent by each party to indicate that the handshake process is complete.

### Error Handling:

 - **Error Detection**: If an error occurs (e.g., message tampering, failed verification, or timeout), the affected party sends an error message detailing the issue.
 - **Retries**: Depending on the error, the parties may retry the handshake process a specified number of times.
 - **Logging and Alerts**: Errors are logged for further investigation, and alerts may be triggered to notify administrators or developers of the failure.
 - **Fallback Mechanisms**: If the handshake fails repeatedly, fallback mechanisms (e.g., alternative communication channels) may be employed to establish a connection.
