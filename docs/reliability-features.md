| **Test Case**                          | **Description**                                                                 | **Expected Outcome**                              | **Implementation Status** |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Simulated Network Failure**          | Validate retry mechanism under network interruptions.                           | Retries the message and delivers successfully.    | ✅                        |
| **Retry Logic with Timeout**           | Verify that retries stop after the maximum configured limit.                    | Stops retries after 3 attempts.                  | ✅                        |
| **Message Acknowledgment Validation**  | Ensure acknowledgment is sent upon successful delivery of a message.            | Acknowledgment is sent correctly.                | ✅                        |
| **Concurrent Message Processing**      | Test mediator's ability to handle multiple concurrent message processing tasks. | All messages are processed without failures.      | ⚪                        |
| **Message Delivery Confirmation**      | Confirm that delivery status is tracked correctly.                              | Tracks and confirms delivery of all messages.     | ⚪                        |
| **Exponential Backoff Strategy**       | Validate exponential backoff timing during retries.                             | Backoff increases exponentially with each retry.  | ❌                        |
| **Connection Timeout Handling**        | Test mediator behavior when connection timeouts occur.                          | Fails gracefully and retries within set limits.   | ❌                        |
| **Queue Overflow Handling**            | Validate the handling of message queue overflow scenarios.                      | Ensures no data loss and processes in order.      | ❌                        |
| **Out-of-Order Message Recovery**      | Test ability to recover and process messages received out of order.             | Processes all messages in correct sequence.       | ⚪                        |
| **Broken Pipe Recovery**               | Validate recovery mechanism when a broken pipe error occurs.                    | Reestablishes connection and retries seamlessly.  | ⚪                        |
