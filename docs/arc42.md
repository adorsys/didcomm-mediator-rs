## 5. Building Block View

### 5.1 Overview

The `didcomm-mediator-rs` project utilizes a plugin-based architecture, allowing modular and extensible implementation of DIDComm messaging protocols. The architecture is divided into two key plugin layers:

1. **Web Plugin Layer**: 
   - Enables plug-and-play of web endpoints.
   - Currently used to implement features such as **DID Endpoints**, **out-of-band messaging**, and **DIDComm messaging**.

2. **DIDComm Messaging Plugin Layer**:
   - Facilitates incremental addition of DIDComm sub-protocols.
   - Modular implementation ensures support for future protocols without major refactoring.

### 5.2 Detailed View

#### Top-Level Architecture

At the core is the *Mediator Server**, responsible for hosting the overall application and enabling the plugin system. The main components are:

1. **Dispatcher**: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate web plugin.
2. **Web Plugin Layer**: Hosts modular implementations for endpoint-specific logic (e.g., DID endpoint generation, out-of-band messaging).
3. **Common DIDComm Processing**: Handles general DIDComm request/response processing applicable across sub-protocols.

#### DIDComm Messaging Plugin Layer

Nested within the DIDComm Messaging endpoint is another plugin system for managing sub-protocols. This includes:

1. **Forward Protocol**: Handles message routing across agents.
2. **Pickup Protocol**: Manages message retrieval by offline agents.
3. **Mediator Coordination Protocol**: Supports agent registration and mediation setup.
4. **Plugin Utilities**: Shared utilities that facilitate sub-protocol implementations.

### 5.3 Building Block Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the layered architecture with the plugin-based system:

### 5.4 Key Advantages of Plugin Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Each protocol or feature can be independently developed, tested, and deployed.
2. **Extensibility**: New protocols or endpoints can be added without significant architectural changes.
3. **Scalability**: Lightweight plugins ensure efficient handling of additional features and traffic.

---

## 6. Runtime View

### 6.1 Message Flow
1. Agent sends a message to the mediator.
2. Mediator stores or forwards the message based on the recipient's status.
3. Recipient retrieves the message via the pickup protocol.

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Agent1->>Mediator: Send Message
    Mediator->>Storage: Store Message
    Agent2->>Mediator: Pickup Request
    Mediator->>Agent2: Deliver Message
```

### 6.2 Mediator Coordination Flow
The Mediation Coordination Protocol is a component of the DIDComm framework, facilitating secure and efficient message routing between agents. It enables a recipient agent to request a mediator agent to handle message forwarding on its behalf. 

**Sequence Diagram: Mediation Coordination Protocol**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Recipient
    participant Mediator

    Recipient->>Mediator: Mediate Request
    alt Mediator Accepts
        Mediator-->>Recipient: Mediate Grant
        Note right of Mediator: Provides routing information
    else Mediator Denies
        Mediator-->>Recipient: Mediate Deny
        Note right of Mediator: Declines mediation request
    end
    alt Recipient Registers Key
        Recipient->>Mediator: Keylist Update
        Mediator-->>Recipient: Keylist Update Response
    end
```

**Illustration: Runtime Interaction**

1. **Mediate Request**: The recipient sends a `mediate-request` message to the mediator, initiating the mediation process.

2. **Mediator's Response**:
   - **Grant**: If the mediator agrees, it responds with a `mediate-grant` message, providing necessary routing details.
   - **Deny**: If the mediator declines, it sends a `mediate-deny` message.

3. **Key Registration**: Upon receiving a grant, the recipient registers its keys with the mediator using a `keylist-update` message. The mediator acknowledges with a `keylist-update-response`.

This interaction ensures that messages intended for the recipient are appropriately routed through the mediator, enhancing communication reliability and security.  

### 6.3 Pickup Protocol
The pickup process allows agents to retrieve messages stored by the mediator. The mediator securely holds messages on behalf of the recipient agents, ensuring their safe and timely retrieval. This process is essential to ensuring reliable message delivery, even when the recipient agent is temporarily unavailable.

1. **Message Storage**
When a message is sent to an agent that is not immediately available to receive it, the mediator stores the message. The message remains encrypted using DIDComm standards to ensure that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the content. Key aspects include:

- Encrypted Storage: Messages are stored in an encrypted format, ensuring the mediator has no access to the content.
- Indexed Storage: Messages are indexed based on the recipient's DID to facilitate efficient lookup and retrieval.

2. **Pickup Request**
The recipient agent initiates the pickup process by sending a pickup request to the mediator. The request must be signed with the agent’s private key to ensure authenticity and prevent unauthorized access. The pickup request contains:

- Recipient DID: To identify which messages are being retrieved.
- Authentication Signature: A cryptographic signature to validate the agent’s identity and access rights.

## 10. Quality Requirements

### Functional
* **Reliable Message Storage and Delivery**: 
  The system must ensure that messages are stored persistently and delivered reliably to the correct recipient, even in the event of system failures. This includes handling retries, acknowledgments, and maintaining message order. The system should support eventual consistency and be able to recover from intermittent network failures, ensuring that no messages are lost during transmission.

* **DID Rotation Support**: 
  The system should support Decentralized Identifier (DID) rotation to ensure secure communication can continue uninterrupted when the keys or identifiers change. This includes the ability to handle key rotation, update trust stores, and ensure that the recipient is aware of the new DID information. Rotation must not disrupt communication, ensuring transparency in key changes and maintaining message integrity through appropriate versioning and key management mechanisms.

### Non-Functional
* **Scalability**: 
  The system must be capable of handling a high number of concurrent connections while maintaining performance and reliability. Scalability can be achieved through load balancing, horizontal scaling across multiple servers, and efficient resource management. Techniques such as data partitioning, caching, and asynchronous processing will ensure that the system can handle increased load without performance degradation.

* **Security**: 
  All messages must be routed and stored in an encrypted format to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data. The system should comply with established cryptographic standards, using public-key encryption for message transmission and ensuring that keys are securely managed. Additional measures like integrity checks (e.g., HMAC, digital signatures) must be used to protect data from tampering or unauthorized access. The system must also support end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the intended recipients can decrypt the messages, with mechanisms for key revocation and renewal built-in.
