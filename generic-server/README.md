# generic-server
## Overview

The Generic Server is a versatile and modular server designed to handle a variety of tasks by leveraging a plugin architecture. This architecture allows users to extend the serverâ€™s capabilities dynamically by adding or modifying plugins without altering the core server code.

## Purpose

The Generic Server provides a foundation for building various server applications.  Its core functionalities include:
- Network communication: Accepts incoming connections and sends responses.
- Security: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Configuration management: Loads and parses configuration files.
- Logging: Records server activity and events.

## plugin architecture
This is the power of generic cerver. It allows developers to extend the server's functionality by creating plugins for specific tasks. These plugins can handle:
- Different communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP)
- Specific data formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
- Custom business logic

## Architecture
The Generic Server follows a modular design with the following key components:

- Core Server: Handles core functionalities like network I/O, configuration, and logging.
- Plugin Manager: Discovers, loads, and manages plugins.
- Plugins: Independent modules extending server capabilities.
  
Plugins communicate with the core server through well-defined interfaces, ensuring loose coupling and facilitating the addition of new features without modifying the core code.

## Building the Generic Server
The Generic Server can be built using various programming languages depending on your preference. Here's a general guideline:

- Choose a language: Popular choices include Python, Java.Heir we have use RUST due to their strong community support and extensive libraries.
- Develop the core server: Implement core functionalities like network communication and configuration management.
- Define plugin interfaces: Create clear interfaces outlining how plugins interact with the core server (e.g., data exchange format, lifecycle methods).
- Develop sample plugins: Build a few basic plugins to demonstrate how functionalities can be extended (e.g., a simple HTTP echo plugin).
- Implement a plugin discovery mechanism: Allow the server to automatically find and load plugins at startup.

## Using the Generic Server
- Once built, you can use the GenConfiguration: Specify desired functionalities through a configuration file. This file defines the plugins to be loaded and their configurations.
- Starting the server: Run the server executable, which will load the configuration and initialize plugins.
- Client interaction: Clients connect to the server using the appropriate protocol defined by loaded plugins (e.g., HTTP requests for an HTTP plugin).
- Plugin execution: The core server routes requests based on configuration and invokes the relevant plugin for handling.eric Server for various purposes:
